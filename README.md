This repo contains datafiles and Jypyter Notebook used  for data prep for the Master thesis of Gijs Kool

The NUTS region data was obtained from the EU website:
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts#nuts2 and only copied here to ensure data integrity when running the analysis. There is no intention of copyright infringement of any kind.

This notebook should run when all files are in a single directory. The last celle of the notebook contains a pip freeze defining the environment and dependencies
